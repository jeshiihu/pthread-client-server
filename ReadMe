Instructions on Compiling Code and Usage:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. to compile all executables and link files, run
	make
2. start one of the two servers
	./server {portnumber} {number of strings in the array}: one mutex solution
	./rwserver {portnumber} {number of strings in the array}: read/write lock
3. run the bash script "./test.sh" to run the client 100 times
	- ensure that the bash script is modified to match with the server's args

If you wish to run the client without the bas script use
	./client {portnumber} {number of strings in the array}
